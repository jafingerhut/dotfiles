#! /bin/sh

# There has *got* to be a better way to do this.  The reason for the
# special cases for a certain number of arguments below is because the
# last 'else' case doesn't work for a command line arg like this:

# fwsd ~/sw -name '*.html'

# If I run that command within a directory that has a file matching
# the pattern *.html, and it matches the 'else' case below and uses $*
# to pass along the args, the file names in the current directory are
# put into the 'find' command line.  If there is only one such file,
# then the find command only finds that file, which isn't what I want.
# If there is more than one such file, then 'find' complains about bad
# command line arguments, which at least makes it obvious that
# something is wrong.  If there are *no* files matching the pattern in
# the current directory does the command work as I wish it to.  This
# is confusing behavior, to say the least.
